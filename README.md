** Getting And Cleaning Data Project Read Me File **

This repo contains these two files -
* run_analysis.R - R script to perform the analysis (see 6 steps below)
* CodeBook.md - document that describes the variables, data, and transformations

This run_analysis.R script will do the following â€“
1. first it will load all the files
2. then it will merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
3. then it will extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
4. After that it will appropriately label the data set
5. then it will use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. and then finally it will melt the data and write the tidy data to a text file
